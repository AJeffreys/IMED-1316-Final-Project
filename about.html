		<article class="right"><p>Hello! My name is Amanda Jeffreys. I've always loved photography, but Photography hasn't always meant as much to me as it does today. That old saying "You don't always know what you've got until it's gone", or at least almost gone in my case, really rang true for me. A little over a year ago I started losing my eyesight. When I was first told the I could go blind, I was overcome with sadness but something else happened as well, I became more visually tuned in to the world around me. I started noticing more and more of the beauty in the world. I wanted to take it all in because in doing so I was helping myself feel better, I guess it was my way of coping. I started pointing everything I saw out to my family when they were with me and I noticed that before I started pointing all these things out, like how the clouds looked different every morning, nobody was noticing. I realized that the beauty that I was seeing was only being seen by myself because of the situation that I was in and that the people I cared about most in the world didnâ€™t see the world the way I did. I picked my camera back up with a new mission in mind. I wanted to photograph all the beauty that I was seeing in the world and share that with everyone I know. </p></article>
